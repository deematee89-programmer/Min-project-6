In this exercise, I loaded the dataset and first performed univariate analysis
checking the data with head() and describe(), and visualizing distributions with histograms.
Then I did correlation analysis using a heatmap to see relationships between numerical variables.
Finally, I ran bivariate analysis with a scatter plot of age versus income. From the analysis,
I observed that income and spending are positively related, older customers tend to have higher income,
and segment C has the highest income and spending.
