================================================================================
This project implements a structured exploratory data analysis process to
understand the dataset and identify key patterns and relationships.

Steps Performed:
1. Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure
2. Performed univariate analysis using head(), describe(), and histograms
3. Computed correlation matrix for numerical features
4. Visualized correlations using a heatmap
5. Conducted bivariate analysis using a scatter plot (age vs income)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insights:
1. Income and spending show a positive relationship
2. Older customers tend to have higher income levels
